    "# Guide to Collaborating on a GitHub Repository Without Conflicts\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a shared GitHub repository, you may run into conflicts when trying to pull updates from the remote repo. Follow these best practices to keep your local copy up to date and avoid issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Always Pull Before Making Changes**\n",
    "Before you start working on any files, ensure your local copy is up to date with the latest version from the remote repository.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git pull origin main\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Avoid Committing Local Changes to the Shared Repository**\n",
    "Since the repository is primarily for distributing class materials, **avoid pushing your local changes** unless explicitly instructed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead, use one of these approaches:\n",
    "- Keep your changes local and do not commit them.\n",
    "- If you want to save your modifications, copy the notebook under a new filename (e.g., `my_notes.ipynb`).\n",
    "- Use branches if you need to track personal changes (see more details below).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Stash or Reset Local Changes Before Pulling**\n",
    "If you've modified files and try to pull updates, Git might block the pull due to conflicts. To avoid this:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 1: Stash Your Changes (Recommended)**\n",
    "  If you want to save your work but still pull updates, stash your changes:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  git stash\n",
    "  git pull origin main\n",
    "  git stash pop  # Restore your changes after pulling\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Option 2: Reset Your Changes (If You Don't Need Them)**\n",
    "  If you don’t need to keep your local modifications, reset them:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  git reset --hard\n",
    "  git pull origin main\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. If You Get a Merge Conflict**\n",
    "Sometimes, Git will warn about conflicts that need to be resolved manually. In this case:\n",
    "- Open the conflicting file (usually a Jupyter notebook).\n",
    "- Look for conflict markers (`<<<<<<<`, `=======`, `>>>>>>>`) and manually edit the file to keep the correct version.\n",
    "- After resolving conflicts, run:\n",
    "  ```sh\n",
    "  git add <file>\n",
    "  git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict\"\n",
    "  git pull origin main\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **5. Clone Again If Things Go Wrong**\n",
    "If you run into persistent issues, a simple way to get a fresh start is to delete your local repository and re-clone it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "rm -rf <repo-folder>\n",
    "git clone <repo-url>\n",
    "```\n",

    "# Using Branches in GitHub for Personal Changes\n",
    "\n",
    "When working with a shared repository, creating personal branches helps keep your changes separate from the main branch. This allows you to modify files without interfering with the latest class materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "## **1. Creating and Switching Branches**\n",
    "To create a new branch and switch to it:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout -b my_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Replace `my_branch` with a meaningful name (e.g., `my_notes`).\n",
    "\n",
    "To switch between branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout main  # Go back to the main branch\n",
    "git checkout my_branch  # Switch back to your branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To see all branches:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **2. Keeping Your Branch Updated**\n",
    "Before making changes, update your branch with the latest version of the class materials:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git checkout main\n",
    "git pull origin main  # Get the latest updates\n",
    "git checkout my_branch\n",
    "git merge main  # Merge updates into your branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "If there are conflicts, resolve them manually, then run:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add <conflicted_file>\n",
    "git commit -m \"Resolved merge conflict\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **3. Saving and Storing Your Work**\n",
    "To save your changes in your branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git add .\n",
    "git commit -m \"Added my notes\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "To store your branch on GitHub (optional):\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git push origin my_branch\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This allows you to access it from other machines, but do not merge it into `main` unless required.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **4. Deleting a Branch (If No Longer Needed)**\n",
    "Once you no longer need a branch:\n",
    "\n",
    "```sh\n",
    "git branch -d my_branch  # Delete locally\n",
    "git push origin --delete my_branch  # Delete from GitHub (if pushed)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## **Quick Summary**\n",
    "✅ **Create a branch:** `git checkout -b my_branch`  \n",
    "✅ **Switch branches:** `git checkout <branch_name>`  \n",
    "✅ **Update your branch:** `git checkout main && git pull origin main && git checkout my_branch && git merge main`  \n",
    "✅ **Save changes:** `git add . && git commit -m \"message\"`  \n",
    "✅ **Delete a branch:** `git branch -d my_branch`  \n",
